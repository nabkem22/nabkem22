- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nabkem22 or Nabeel Kemal
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major at Wesleyan University interested in building Deep Learning Models using Tensorflow and Keras. I code 
primarily in Python and have been coding for 3 years. Most recently, I have been working on building a Deep Learning Model to predict the conformational
substate selection of the protein p53, using data collected from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations tracking the pairwise energetics data within the protein at
given residues. This novel method of predicting whether or not a protein is mutated/cancerous currently yields a 98% accuracy for a 5 residue sample. I hope to
continue to grow my skillset in Deep Learning techniques and models as well as writing more efficient algorithms in Python.
