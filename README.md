- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nabkem22 or Nabeel Kemal
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major at Wesleyan University interested in building Machine Learning Models using Tensorflow and Keras. 
- I code primarily in Python and have been coding for 5 years. Most recently, I have been working on building a Deep Learning Model to predict the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, using data generated from Molecular Dynamics simluations. Currently, this novel method of predicting whether or not a protein is mutated/cancerous currently yields a 99% accuracy when tested on the protein p53. I hope to continue to grow my skillset in Deep Learning techniques and models as well as writing more efficient algorithms in Python.
